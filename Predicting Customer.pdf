Project Title: Predicting Customer Churn in a Telecom Company

Project Description:
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn (cancel their subscription) in a telecom company. By analyzing customer data and usage patterns, we can create a model that predicts churn and helps the company take proactive measures to retain customers.

Dataset Description:
The dataset for this project consists of customer information, usage data, and churn status. It includes the following features:

Customer Information:

Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Gender: Gender of the customer.
Age: Age of the customer.
Location: Geographic location of the customer.
Subscription Length: Duration of the customer's subscription.
Usage Data:

Monthly Charges: The amount charged to the customer on a monthly basis.
Data Usage: The amount of data used by the customer.
Call Duration: The total duration of calls made by the customer.
Churn Status:

Churn: Binary variable indicating whether the customer churned (1) or not (0).
Project Steps:

Data Collection: Obtain the dataset containing customer information, usage data, and churn status from the telecom company. Ensure that the dataset includes a sufficient number of churned and non-churned customers for accurate model training.

Data Preprocessing: Perform necessary preprocessing steps on the dataset, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if required. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of features, identify any correlations, and gain insights into customer behavior patterns that might be associated with churn.

Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to capture relevant information that can improve the performance of the predictive model. For example, you can calculate the average monthly charges or call duration over a specific period.

Model Training: Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, to train the churn prediction model using the training dataset. Tune the hyperparameters of the model to optimize its performance.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using the testing dataset. Use evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's ability to correctly predict churned customers.

Deployment: Once the model is developed and evaluated, deploy it as a predictive tool that takes customer information as input and provides a churn prediction. This tool can be integrated into the company's customer management system to help identify customers at risk of churn and implement retention strategies.
